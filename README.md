# Auction-Bot

This is a discord bot made in go, its a wip and will be updated over time. This bot atm can create channels in your discord for users to place bids on, theres commands to handle individuals that spam inaccurate values and a cap on bidding so millions of dollars in troll currency cannot be added.

To add mods / individuals who can manage your program / bids etc, /add-mod is used to do so, server owners by default have access to the bot.

# Usage

The usage is fairly simple, all your need is the discord bot token your using and your need to add it to your discord.
